#### My Story begins now

I've been playing the guitar for 20 years, and I started playing in bands at a young age. Initially, I was part of rock/metal bands, and later I performed in numerous concerts, notably at some of France's premier venues such as Le Poche in BÃ©thune and Le Splendid in Lille. At the age of 15, I began teaching myself computer-assisted music and developed a deep passion for composing music for visual media. I create numerous compositions for visuals that you can discover on my website for major competitions such as Score Relief. I also write compositions for travel and road trip visual clips for the brand Take Your Bagage. Additionally, I compose introductory music for live shopping events for brands like Boulanger. I also compose music for short films for the production company Zero IdÃ©e Production, notably for the short film "Les choses qui vont bien." All these allow me to gain relevant experience for creating the best musics for your project. Don't hesitate to contact me or take a "Rendez-vous" ðŸ˜‰
